      article:
        "Exercising for just half an hour a day can greatly improve your physical and mental health. It boosts cardiovascular fitness, strengthens muscles, and enhances flexibility. Activities like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or yoga can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Exercise also releases endorphins, improving mood, reducing stress, and enhancing overall well-being. Consistency is key—choose activities you enjoy to make it a daily habit. Start small and stay committed!",
